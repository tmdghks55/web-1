      Chernobyl disaster was a nuclear accident that
      occurred on Saturday 26 April 1986, at the No. 4 reactor in the Chernobyl
      Nuclear Power Plant, near the city of Pripyat in the north of the Ukrainian
      SSR in the Soviet Union. It is considered the worst nuclear disaster in
      history both in terms of cost and casualties, and is one of only two nuclear
      energy accidents rated at seven—the maximum severity—on the International
      Nuclear Event Scale, the other being the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear
      disaster in Japan. The initial emergency response, together with later
      decontamination of the environment, ultimately involved more than
      500,000 personnel and cost an estimated 18 billion Soviet rubles—roughly
      US$68 billion in 2019, adjusted for inflation.</p>
