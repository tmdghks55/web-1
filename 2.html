    <h2>Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster</h2>
    <p>The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster was a 2011 nuclear accident at
        the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in Ōkuma, Fukushima Prefecture,
        Japan. The event was caused by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.
        It was the most severe nuclear accident since the Chernobyl disaster in
        1986. It was classified as Level 7 on the International Nuclear Event
        Scale (INES), after initially being classified as Level 5,
        joining Chernobyl as the only other accident to receive such classific
        ation. While the 1957 explosion at the Mayak facility was the seco
        nd worst by radioactivity released, the INES ranks incidents by impact
        on population, so Chernobyl (335,000 people evacuated) and Fukushima
        (154,000 evacuated) rank higher than the 10,000 evacuated from the
        classified restricted Mayak site in rural Siberia.</p>
