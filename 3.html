    <h2>Kyshtym disaster</h2>
    <p>The Kyshtym disaster, sometimes referred to as the Mayak disaster or Ozy
      orsk disaster in newer sources, was a radioactive contamination accident
      that occurred on 29 September 1957 at Mayak, a plutonium production site
       for nuclear weapons and nuclear fuel reprocessing plant located in the
        closed city of Chelyabinsk-40 (now Ozyorsk) in Chelyabinsk Oblast,
        Russian SFSR, Soviet Union.
        The disaster was the second worst nuclear incident (by radioactivity re
        leased) after the Chernobyl disaster. It measured as a Level 6 disaster
         on the International Nuclear Event Scale (INES), making it the thir
         d highest on the INES (which ranks by population impact), behind Chern
         obyl (evacuated 335,000 people) and the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disa
         ster (evacuated 154,000 people) which are both Level 7 on the INES. A
         t least twenty-two villages were exposed to radiation from the Kysht
         ym disaster, with a total population of around 10,000 people evacuat
         ed. Some were evacuated after a week, but it took almost two years f
         or evacuations to occur at other sites.</p>
